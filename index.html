# Hello everybody and welcome to my page! 

## This page is created for the class of 141B- Data Technology and Web Applications taught by Prof. James Sharpnack. 
## Hopefully, I'll have time to add links to the codes I have been working on during this class so that you can access them. Each notebook, do different tasks and use different modules. 

  
  
 Thanks for visiting! </body>
