</p>

I a Statistics Master's student alumni of University of California, Davis. I also possess a bachelors degree in Bio-Mathematics from the Universidad Metropolitana, Cupey Campus in Puerto Rico.

My research interests are in: statistical genetics, bioinformatics, data mining and machine learning.  Overall, no matter what the application is, I am just passionate about data analysis and the insight data can gives us to solve several problems.  I like to think of myself as a passionate problem-solver; I tend to forget time actually exists once I am embedded in finding a solution. It can be thrilling!

# Projects:
### **Exploring Stock Correlation of the S&P 500 Index** 
This project was done in collaboration with Tongke Wu and Wenquian Li.  It focuses on the analyis of the close stock prices for the S&P 500 for the years 2008-2016. We explored this data by looking at trends of sectors over the years, correlations among stocks and exploring the diverse applications such as portfolio selection, and its performance in the market.  Our dataset allowed us to observe the effect that crisis has on the market, and also how stock are interrelated through the use of network visualizations and relatedness statistics.
