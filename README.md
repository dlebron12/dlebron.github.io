# Disclaimer:
This page is created for the class of 141B- Data Technology and Web Applications taught by [Prof. James Sharpnack](https://jsharpna.github.io).  The following links direct you to the jupyter notebook containing some of the assignments, I've worked on during this class so that you can access them. In each notebook, I learned how to do different tasks and used different modules.
