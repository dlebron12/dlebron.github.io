Hello All! and Welcome to my Github Repo.

A little about me, I possess a MS in Statistics with a Data Science Track from the University of California, Davis. I also achieved a Bachelors degree in Applied Mathematics to Biology (Bio-Mathematics).  My skills allow me to excel in jobs related to Data Science, Statistics and Programming. 

My research interests are in: statistical genetics, bioinformatics, data mining and machine learning.  Overall, no matter what the application is, I am just passionate about data analysis and the insight data can gives us to solve real problems.  I like to think of myself as a passionate problem-solver; although I tend to be forgetful at times.  Nevertheless, I am very passionate about my work, more so that I tend to forget time exists when I delve into solving a problem. It can be thrilling!

# Projects:
### **Exploring Stock Correlation of the S&P 500 Index** 
This project was done in collaboration with Tongke Wu and Wenquian Li.  It focuses on the analyis of the close stock prices for the S&P 500 for the years 2008-2016. We explored this data by looking at trends of sectors over the years, correlations among stocks and exploring the diverse applications such as portfolio selection, and its performance in the market.  Our dataset allowed us to observe the effect that crisis has on the market, and also how stock are interrelated through the use of network visualizations and relatedness statistics.

## Bioinformatics Applications: Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit 2015 Update

This project focused in updating the database to add new strain taxonomical information. A very important part of the task was to see how our actual database would predict these new strains, in order to see if we needed to actually add them or if keeping the information at specie level was enough to detect these strains variations.  You will see several scripts where we confirm that the correct identification from LMAT was made by BLAST-ing the sequence.  Most of the scripts there are mostly for data mining (i.e downloading massive amount of data from ncbi, extracting the BLAST hits and compiling in a table and etc.) Please see the summarized work in the poster below, scripts are in this repo [lmat-2015update](https://github.com/dlebron12/lmat-2015update)
