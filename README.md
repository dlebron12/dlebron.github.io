</p>

I am a Statistics master's student at UC Davis. I possess a bachelors degree in Bio-Mathematics from Universidad Metropolitana, Cupey Campus in Puerto Rico.

My research interests are in: statistical genetics, bioinformatics and data mining. Nevertheless, I would like to indulge into machine learning.

**CS Skills:** C++, R, Perl, Bash and now Python!

# Projects:
### **Exploring Stock Correlation of the S&P 500 Index** 
This project was done in collaboration with Tongke Wu and Wenquian Li.  It focuses on the analyis of the close stock prices for the S&P 500 for the years 2008-2016. We explored this data by looking at trends of sectors over the years, correlations among stocks and exploring the diverse applications such as portfolio selection, and its performance in the market.  Our dataset allowed us to observe the effect that crisis has on the market, and also how stock are interrelated through the use of network visualizations and relatedness statistics.

### **Updating Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit (LMAT) Database: Screening novel microbial genomes to improve infectious disease diagnostics** 

The Livermore Metagenomic Analysis Toolkit was built by my mentor Jonathan Allen and peers, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  LMAT contains the complete genomes of NCBI up to 2015, in addition, to a large compilation of human genomes yielded to us by the Human Genome Project. LMAT is great for getting the taxonomy identification of unknown sequences. Part of my work has been to analyze and create a quality control pipeline to identify genomes that are suitable to be included in the database update. The graphic belows explain results of Phase 1 our of 5 Phases.
