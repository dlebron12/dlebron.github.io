# About Me: 

I am a Statistics master's student at UC Davis. I possess a bachelors degree in Bio-Mathematics from Universidad Metropolitana, Cupey Campus in Puerto Rico, where I am native from. 

Currently, I am working at Livermore National Laboratory in the area of Bioinformatics. My research interests are in: statistical genetics, bioinformatics, data mining and would like to indulge into machine learning.

**CS Skills: ** C++, R, Perl, Bash and now Python! 

This page is created for the class of 141B- Data Technology and Web Applications taught by [Prof. James Sharpnack](https://jsharpna.github.io).  The following links direct you to the jupyter notebook containing some of the assignments, I've worked on during this class so that you can access them. In each notebook, I learned how to do different tasks and used different modules.
